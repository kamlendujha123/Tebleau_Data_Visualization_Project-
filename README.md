# Tebleau_Data_Visualization_Project-
In this project, we explore a comprehensive Superstore dataset to answer 30 scenario-based business questions using data visualization and analysis. Our objective is to not only derive insights from the data but also to thoughtfully select the most appropriate visual representation for each question.
